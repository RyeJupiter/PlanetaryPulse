      <h1>Why Planetary Pulse</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Regeneration is happening, yet verification remains fragmented. Planetary Pulse makes
        landscape impact on local climate visible so improvements can be tracked consistently.

          <div class="cardBody">
            Ecological outcomes are often communicated through isolated metrics,
            inconsistent baselines, and hard-to-interpret reports.

        <div class="card">
          <div class="cardTitle">The opportunity</div>
          <div class="cardBody">
            Satellite and climate datasets can reveal landscape impact on local climate in hydrology,
            vegetation, thermal regulation, and resilience when aggregated into clear Earth metrics.

          <div class="cardTitle">Our approach</div>
          <div class="cardBody">
            Planetary Pulse will compare project areas to matched controls over time,
            integrate multiple Earth metrics, and clearly present uncertainty and resolution limits.
          </div>

          <div class="cardTitle">The outcome</div>
          <div class="cardBody">
            A shared, credible language of change that helps practitioners, funders, communities,
            and policymakers see what is working and where to focus next.

      <p class="lede">
        Climate is not only atmospheric. It is the macro-pattern that emerges from countless local
        land conditions repeated across space and time. Restoring landscape function is therefore
        a practical path to stabilizing climate behavior.
